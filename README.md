## Project Name: Zeraki Sales Agent Dashboard

### Project Overview:
The Zeraki Sales Agent Dashboard is a responsive web application developed to streamline operations for sales agents, enabling efficient management of school accounts, invoicing, and collections. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key performance indicators and data visualization for targets and sign-ups related to Zeraki's products (Zeraki Analytics, Zeraki Finance, and Zeraki Timetable) across various educational sectors.

### Setup Instructions:
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub link provided: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Ciamuthama/Sales_Dashboard).
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the project dependencies using the package manager of your choice (npm or yarn):

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```
4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` or the specified port.

### Key Design Decisions:
1. **Framework**: The project is built using the latest stable version of React to ensure a robust and scalable application architecture.
2. **Data Handling**: The application utilizes mock JSON data and mock APIs to simulate real-time data updates without dependency on a backend server. Mock APIs like Json Server are recommended for creating a full mock REST API using simple JSON files.
3. **UI Design**: Emphasis is placed on creating a clean, modern aesthetic design with intuitive interfaces for easy navigation. Custom design elements are utilized instead of templates to ensure a unique and user-friendly experience.
4. **Interactivity**: Interactive elements such as tooltips on hover are implemented for detailed information display, enhancing user engagement and usability.
5. **Visualization**: Visual representations like pie charts and bar graphs are employed to present data analytics and distribution effectively, facilitating informed decision-making for sales agents.
